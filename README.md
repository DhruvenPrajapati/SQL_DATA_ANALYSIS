# SQL_DATA_ANALYSIS

**In this Analysis my main focus is on SQL Data Exploration.**

I am using SQL to do some Data Exploration and then visualize the data in Tableau in the next part.

Here I am using the cloud database Microsoft Azure SQL Database as part of Microsoft Azure services and SQL server management studio for script writing.
However, you can use any SQL database, cloud technology, etc...

**Data Source**
Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths use this link to get a dataset of multiple countries that you like.

This dataset is so large that you can work on lots of things in this dataset. Initially, from the original dataset after a little bit of exploration in Excel, I created two separate file
called **covidDeaths.xlsx** and **covidVaccinations.xlsx** with limited feature.

I am using Azure SQL database (Cloud) and then connecting with SQL Server Management Studio using server authentication so it will link my Azure SQL DATABASE.
Also, for importing data I am using SQL Server Import and Export Wizard it will take time based on the size of the data, but it will work.
